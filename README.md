# UFOs


##__Purpose:__

The aim of this project is to build a dynamic webpage that filters and displays required data in a table format, based on user input.This is accomplished by using Javascript on an HTML page and using Bootstrap and CSS to format and style the page. 

In this case, the webpage will display UFO sighting related information in an interactive and neatly presented webpage based on available raw data of variopus UFO sightings. Filters will be available for users to enter search criteria such as location, date and other details, so that the data is displayed based on criteria entered.


##__Results__:

The webpage created can be seen in the screenshot below:


The webpage has an attractive header with a write up about the data analysis of UFO sightings. Beneath that is a table which by default displays all the data on UFO sightings based on our raw data available. A user can scroll down to see the data, however that would be voluminous.

To address this, the Filter Search section is available beside the table with the following filter criteria:
- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape

Each field contains an example of the format in which the criteria should be entered by the user.

The Filter Search can be seen in the screenshot below:

In order to filter the tabular data to make it more concise or to only view data of interest, the uder can enter search criteria in the search fields. For example, if a user is looking for information onsightings in New Mexio, he/she can enter "nm" in the "Enter State" field and hit enter on their keyboard.

The data table will change automatically and only display sighting information for New Mexico as can be seen below:


If the user wants to search for a combination of filter criteria, he/she can enter in multiple fields too, and the table would display all the data relevant to the combination of search fields.For example, of the user wants to view sightings only in Albuquerque, New Mexico, they can enter both the city and state in the filter search and hit enter on the keyboard. The table will display only data that meet both of these criteria, as seen below:
